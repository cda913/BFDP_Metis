# Minimum Viable Product 

### Background

Maryson's, an online clothing retailer. They had 12,330 visits to their site over the course of the year; only 1,908 visits resulted in purchases. I would like to help them convert traffic to sales. 

### MVP

Maryson's has released a limited description of their web traffic over the past year. The description does not include January or April. It does include type of page(s) visited by each visitor, overall length the visitor stayed on the page types, and some technical details about the visits. I have found people do not spend a lot of time on the website overall, even if making a purchase

### To Do

- Determine if the other types of pages have a different pattern
- Analyze the technical details
- Propose next steps
