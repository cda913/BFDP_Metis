# Minimum Viable Product 

### Background

Maryson's, an online clothing retailer had 12,330 visits to their site over the course of the year; only 1,908 visits resulted in purchases. I would like to help them identify some actions that would convert traffic to sales. 

### Business Goal

We want to convert 5% of the number of non-purchasing visitors to purchasing visitors.

### Initial Visualization

Maryson's has released only a limited description of their web traffic. The data is about the 12,330 visits and includes type of page(s) visited by each visitor (Administrative, Informational, or Product), overall length the visitor stayed on each the page types, and some technical details about the visits. Initial findings show people who are purchasing spend slightly longer, although this may be because they are purchasing.
