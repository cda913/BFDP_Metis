# Minimum Viable Product 

### Background

Maryson's, an online clothing retailer had 12,330 visits to their site over the course of the year; only 1,908 visits resulted in purchases. I would like to help them identify some actions that would convert traffic to sales. 

### MVP

Maryson's has released only a limited description of their web traffic. It includes type of page(s) visited by each visitor, overall length the visitor stayed on the page types, and some technical details about the visits. Initial findings show people who are purchasing spend slightly longer, possibly because they come with a plan to purchase.

### To Do

- Business hypothesis
- Determine if the other types of pages have a different pattern
- Analyze the technical details to see if they offer insights
