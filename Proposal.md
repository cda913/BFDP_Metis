# Proposal

Wegman's, a regional upscale grocery store headquartered in upstate New York, is looking to expand their business. I will look at the increase in per capita income by county to recommend locations that look like good targets for new stores.

I will be using the US Bureau of Economic Analysis Annual Personal Income by County for the 13 states nearest New York (inlcuding New York State) through 2019 (the latest available), the USBEA Personal Income by State through the second quarter of 2021, and the US Federal Housing and Finance Agency's house price indexes which covers 100 metro areas across the US through 2021.

For an MVP, I will present a graph of the increase per capita income for 2018 to 2019.
