# Proposal

Maryson's, an online clothing company, gets a lot of visitors but not a lot of sales. By analysing web-traffic, I'm hoping to show how Maryson's can improve their website to increase sales. 

I will be using [UCI Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset). This is a year's worth of data from a website. It shows how long each person stayed on the site, what pages of three kinds (Admininstrative, Informational, and Product) the person visited, on what kind of page they spent the most time, from what kind of page they left, and some additional data. 

For an MVP, I will present a graph of the amount of time spent on product-pages vs. purchase. For the final presentation, I will present the visit duration and behavior in more detail.
